# TRay

TRay for "yet another Ray Tracer".

Served as my bachelor's undergraduate graduation project, now as a playground for leaning rendering.

# Build and Run

TRay is OK with clang 15.0.7. Some builtin function may fail MSVC.

`cd build` and `build ..` should be ok. The required libs should be libglfw.a only, for supporting ImGUI and some other features based on OpenGL.

I dislike build systems, so any related problems please work it out by yourself. I am trying to make it OK on most platforms, by writing (for me) most portable codes.
